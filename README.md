# Holidays ascii art for bash

These scripts will output art for each holiday(eventually) in your terminal window every time it loads.

To use, clone the repo somewhere, add `{location of directory}/holidays/holiday.sh` to the top of your `.bashrc`.

Also consider adding aliases for the individual scripts:
```
alias spooky='~/holidays/spooky.sh'
alias gobble='~/holidays/gobble.sh'
alias jingle='~/holidays/jingle.sh'
```
