# Holidays ascii art for bash

These scripts will output art for each holiday(eventually) in your terminal window every time it loads.  Currently, it will switch art based on system date month.  More art to be added for future momnths.

To use, clone the repo somewhere, then add the following to the top of your '.bashrc': 
```
/{location of directory}/holiday.sh
```


Also consider adding aliases for the individual scripts:
```
alias varmit='/{location of directory}/art/varmit.sh'
alias dream='/{location of directory}/art/dream.sh'
alias spooky='/{location of directory}/art/spooky.sh'
alias gobble='/{location of directory}/art/gobble.sh'
alias jingle='/{location of directory}/art/jingle.sh'
```

See `/samples` for sample images.
